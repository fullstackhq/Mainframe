      MAINFRAME - COBOL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS 
        Name the divisions in a COBOL program. 
        IDENTIFICATION DIVISION, ENVIRONMENT DIVISION, DATA DIVISION, PROCEDURE 
        DIVISION.
        What are the different data types available in COBOL? 
        Alpha-numeric (X), alphabetic (A) and numeric (9).
        What does the INITIALIZE verb do? ï¿½ 
        Alphabetic, Alphanumeric fields & alphanumeric edited items are set to 
        SPACES.
        Numeric, Numeric edited items set to ZERO.
        FILLER , OCCURS DEPENDING ON items left untouched.
        What is 77 level used for ?
      Elementary level item. Cannot be subdivisions of other items (cannot be 
      qualified), nor can they be subdivided themselves.
        What is 88 level used for ? 
        For condition names.
        What is level 66 used for ? 
        For RENAMES clause.
        What does the IS NUMERIC clause establish ? 
        IS NUMERIC can be used on alphanumeric items, signed numeric & packed 
        decimal items and usigned numeric & packed decimal items. IS NUMERIC 
        returns TRUE if the item only consists of 0-9. However, if the item 
        being tested is a signed item, then it may contain 0-9, + and - .
        How do you define a table/array in COBOL? 
        01 ARRAYS.
        05 ARRAY1 PIC X(9) OCCURS 10 TIMES.
        05 ARRAY2 PIC X(6) OCCURS 20 TIMES INDEXED BY WS-INDEX.
        Can the OCCURS clause be at the 01 level? 
        No.
        What is the difference between index and subscript? 
        Subscript refers to the array occurrence while index is the displacement 
        (in no of bytes) from the beginning of the array. An index can only be 
        modified using PERFORM, SEARCH & SET.
        Need to have index for a table in order to use SEARCH, SEARCH ALL.
        What is the difference between SEARCH and SEARCH ALL? 
        SEARCH - is a serial search.
        SEARCH ALL - is a binary search & the table must be sorted ( 
        ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY clause to be used & data loaded in this order) 
        before using SEARCH ALL.
        What should be the sorting order for SEARCH ALL? 
        It can be either ASCENDING or DESCENDING. ASCENDING is default. If you 
        want the search to be done on an array sorted in descending order, then 
        while defining the array, you should give DESCENDING KEY clause. (You 
        must load the table in the specified order).
        What is binary search? 
        Search on a sorted array. Compare the item to be searched with the item 
        at the center. If it matches, fine else repeat the process with the left 
        half or the right half depending on where the item lies.
        My program has an array defined to have 10 items. Due to a bug, I find 
        that even if the program access the 11th item in this array, the program 
        does not abend. What is wrong with it? 
        Must use compiler option SSRANGE if you want array bounds checking. 
        Default is NOSSRANGE.
        How do you sort in a COBOL program? Give sort file definition, sort 
        statement syntax and meaning. 
        Syntax:
        SORT file-1 ON ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY key....
        USING file-2
        GIVING file-3.
        USING can be substituted by INPUT PROCEDURE IS para-1 THRU para-2
        GIVING can be substituted by OUTPUT PROCEDURE IS para-1 THRU para-2.
        file-1 is the sort workfile and must be described using SD entry in FILE 
        SECTION.
        file-2 is the input file for the SORT and must be described using an FD 
        entry in FILE SECTION and SELECT clause in FILE CONTROL. 
        file-3 is the outfile from the SORT and must be described using an FD 
        entry in FILE SECTION and SELECT clause in FILE CONTROL.
        file-1, file-2 & file-3 should not be opened explicitly.
        INPUT PROCEDURE is executed before the sort and records must be RELEASEd 
        to the sort work file from the input procedure.
        OUTPUT PROCEDURE is executed after all records have been sorted. Records 
        from the sort work file must be RETURNed one at a time to the output 
        procedure.
        How do you define a sort file in JCL that runs the COBOL program? 
        Use the SORTWK01, SORTWK02,..... dd names in the step. Number of sort 
        datasets depends on the volume of data being sorted, but a minimum of 3 
        is required.
        What are the two ways of doing sorting in a COBOL program? Give the 
        formats. 
        See question 16.
        Give the format of USING and GIVING in SORT statement. What are the 
        restrictions with it? 
        See question 16. Restrictions - Cannot massage records, canot select 
        records to be sorted.
        What is the difference between performing a SECTION and a PARAGRAPH? 
        Performing a SECTION will cause all the paragraphs that are part of the 
        section, to be performed. 
        Performing a PARAGRAPH will cause only that paragraph to be performed.
        What is the use of EVALUATE statement? 
        Evaluate is like a case statement and can be used to replace nested Ifs. 
        The difference between EVALUATE and case is that no 'break' is required 
        for EVALUATE i.e. control comes out of the EVALUATE as soon as one match 
        is made.
        What are the different forms of EVALUATE statement? 
        EVALUATE EVALUATE SQLCODE ALSO FILE-STATUS
        WHEN A=B AND C=D WHEN 100 ALSO '00'
        imperative stmt imperative stmt 
        WHEN (D+X)/Y = 4 WHEN -305 ALSO '32'
        imperative stmt imperative stmt
        WHEN OTHER WHEN OTHER
        imperative stmt imperative stmt
        END-EVALUATE END-EVALUATE
        EVALUATE SQLCODE ALSO A=B EVALUATE SQLCODE ALSO TRUE
        WHEN 100 ALSO TRUE WHEN 100 ALSO A=B
        imperative stmt imperative stmt
        WHEN -305 ALSO FALSE WHEN -305 ALSO (A/C=4)
        imperative stmt imperative stmt
        END-EVALUATE END-EVALUATE
        How do you come out of an EVALUATE statement? 
        After the execution of one of the when clauses, the control is 
        automatically passed on to the next sentence after the EVALUATE 
        statement. There is no need of any extra code.
        In an EVALUATE statement, can I give a complex condition on a when 
        clause? 
        Yes.
        What is a scope terminator? Give examples. 
        Scope terminator is used to mark the end of a verb e.g. EVALUATE, 
        END-EVALUATE; IF, END-IF.
        How do you do in-line PERFORM? 
        PERFORM ... ... 
        END PERFORM
        When would you use in-line perform?
      When the body of the perform will not be used in other paragraphs. If the 
      body of the perform is a generic type of code (used from various other 
      places in the program), it would be better to put the code in a separate 
      para and use PERFORM paraname rather than in-line perform.
      27. What is the difference between CONTINUE & NEXT SENTENCE ?
      CONTINUE is like a null statement (do nothing) , while NEXT SENTENCE 
      transfers control to the next sentence (!!) (A sentence is terminated by a 
      period)
        What does EXIT do ? 
        Does nothing ! If used, must be the only sentence within a paragraph.
        Can I redefine an X(100) field with a field of X(200)? 
        Yes. Redefines just causes both fields to start at the same location. 
        For example:
        01 WS-TOP PIC X(1)
        01 WS-TOP-RED REDEFINES WS-TOP PIC X(2).
        If you MOVE '12' to WS-TOP-RED, 
        DISPLAY WS-TOP will show 1 while 
        DISPLAY WS-TOP-RED will show 12. 
        Can I redefine an X(200) field with a field of X(100) ? 
        Yes.
        What do you do to resolve SOC-7 error? 
        Basically you need to correcting the offending data.
        Many times the reason for SOC7 is an un-initialized numeric item. 
        Examine that possibility first.
        Many installations provide you a dump for run time abends ( it can be 
        generated also by calling some subroutines or OS services thru assembly 
        language). These dumps provide the offset of the last instruction at 
        which the abend occurred. Examine the compilation output XREF listing to 
        get the verb and the line number of the source code at this offset. Then 
        you can look at the source code to find the bug. To get capture the 
        runtime dumps, you will have to define some datasets (SYSABOUT etc ) in 
        the JCL.
        If none of these are helpful, use judgement and DISPLAY to localize the 
        source of error.
        Some installtion might have batch program debugging tools. Use them.
        How is sign stored in Packed Decimal fields and Zoned Decimal fields? 
        Packed Decimal fields: Sign is stored as a hex value in the last nibble 
        (4 bits ) of the storage.
        Zoned Decimal fields: As a default, sign is over punched with the 
        numeric value stored in the last bite.
        How is sign stored in a comp-3 field? 
        It is stored in the last nibble. For example if your number is +100, it 
        stores hex 0C in the last byte, hex 1C if your number is 101, hex 2C if 
        your number is 102, hex 1D if the number is -101, hex 2D if the number 
        is -102 etc... 
        How is sign stored in a COMP field ? 
        In the most significant bit. Bit is on if -ve, off if +ve.
        What is the difference between COMP & COMP-3 ? 
        COMP is a binary storage format while COMP-3 is packed decimal format.
        What is COMP-1? COMP-2? 
        COMP-1 - Single precision floating point. Uses 4 bytes.
        COMP-2 - Double precision floating point. Uses 8 bytes.
        How do you define a variable of COMP-1? COMP-2? 
        No picture clause to be given. Example 01 WS-VAR USAGE COMP-1.
        How many bytes does a S9(7) COMP-3 field occupy ? 
        Will take 4 bytes. Sign is stored as hex value in the last nibble.
        General formula is INT((n/2) + 1)), where n=7 in this example.
        How many bytes does a S9(7) SIGN TRAILING SEPARATE field occupy ? 
        Will occupy 8 bytes (one extra byte for sign).
        How many bytes will a S9(8) COMP field occupy ? 
        4 bytes. 
        What is the maximum value that can be stored in S9(8) COMP? 
        99999999
        What is COMP SYNC? 
        Causes the item to be aligned on natural boundaries. Can be SYNCHRONIZED 
        LEFT or RIGHT.
        For binary data items, the address resolution is faster if they are 
        located at word boundaries in the memory. For example, on main frame the 
        memory word size is 4 bytes. This means that each word will start from 
        an address divisible by 4. If my first variable is x(3) and next 
        one is s9(4) comp, then if you do not specify the SYNC clause, S9(4) 
        COMP will start from byte 3 ( assuming that it starts from 0 ). If you 
        specify SYNC, then the binary data item will start from address 4. You 
        might see some wastage of memory, but the access to this 
        computational field is faster. 
        What is the maximum size of a 01 level item in COBOL I? in COBOL II? 
        In COBOL II: 16777215
        How do you reference the following file formats from COBOL programs: 
        Fixed Block File - Use ORGANISATION IS SEQUENTIAL. Use RECORDING MODE IS 
        F, BLOCK CONTAINS 0 .
        Fixed Unblocked - Use ORGANISATION IS SEQUENTIAL. Use RECORDING MODE IS 
        F, do not use BLOCK CONTAINS
        Variable Block File - Use ORGANISATION IS SEQUENTIAL. Use RECORDING MODE 
        IS V, BLOCK CONTAINS 0. Do not code the 4 bytes for record length in FD 
        ie JCL rec length will be max rec length in pgm + 4
        Variable Unblocked - Use ORGANISATION IS SEQUENTIAL. Use RECORDING MODE 
        IS V, do not use BLOCK CONTAINS. Do not code 4 bytes for record length 
        in FD ie JCL rec length will be max rec length in pgm + 4.
        ESDS VSAM file - Use ORGANISATION IS SEQUENTIAL. 
        KSDS VSAM file - Use ORGANISATION IS INDEXED, RECORD KEY IS, ALTERNATE 
        RECORD KEY IS
        RRDS File - Use ORGANISATION IS RELATIVE, RELATIVE KEY IS
        Printer File - Use ORGANISATION IS SEQUENTIAL. Use RECORDING MODE IS F, 
        BLOCK CONTAINS 0. (Use RECFM=FBA in JCL DCB).
        What are different file OPEN modes available in COBOL? 
        Open for INPUT, OUTPUT, I-O, EXTEND.
        What is the mode in which you will OPEN a file for writing? 
        OUTPUT, EXTEND
        In the JCL, how do you define the files referred to in a subroutine ? 
        Supply the DD cards just as you would for files referred to in the main 
        program. 
        Can you REWRITE a record in an ESDS file? Can you DELETE a record from 
        it? 
        Can rewrite(record length must be same), but not delete.
        What is file status 92? 
        Logic error. e.g., a file is opened for input and an attempt is made to 
        write to it.
        What is file status 39 ? 
        Mismatch in LRECL or BLOCKSIZE or RECFM between your COBOL pgm & the JCL 
        (or the dataset label). You will get file status 39 on an OPEN.
        What is Static,Dynamic linking ? 
        In static linking, the called subroutine is link-edited into the calling 
        program , while in dynamic linking, the subroutine & the main program 
        will exist as separate load modules. You choose static/dynamic linking 
        by choosing either the DYNAM or NODYNAM link edit option. (Even if you 
        choose NODYNAM, a CALL identifier (as opposed to a CALL literal), will 
        translate to a DYNAMIC call).
        A statically called subroutine will not be in its initial state the next 
        time it is called unless you explicitly use INITIAL or you do a CANCEL. 
        A dynamically called routine will always be in its initial state.
        What is AMODE(24), AMODE(31), RMODE(24) and RMODE(ANY)? ( applicable to 
        only 
      MVS/ESA Enterprise Server).
      These are compile/link edit options.
      AMODE - Addressing mode. RMODE - Residency mode.
      AMODE(24) - 24 bit addressing. AMODE(31) - 31 bit addressing. AMODE(ANY) - 
      Either 24 bit or 31 bit addressing depending on RMODE.
      RMODE(24) - Resides in virtual storage below 16 Meg line. Use this for 31 
      bit programs that call 24 bit programs. (OS/VS Cobol pgms use 24 bit 
      addresses only).
      RMODE(ANY) - Can reside above or below 16 Meg line. 
        What compiler option would you use for dynamic linking? 
        DYNAM.
        What is SSRANGE, NOSSRANGE ? 
        These are compiler options w.r.t subscript out of range checking. 
        NOSSRANGE is the default and if chosen, no run time error will be 
        flagged if your index or subscript goes out of the permissible range.
        How do you set a return code to the JCL from a COBOL program? 
        Move a value to RETURN-CODE register. RETURN-CODE should not be declared 
        in your program.
        How can you submit a job from COBOL programs? 
        Write JCL cards to a dataset with 
        //xxxxxxx SYSOUT=(A,INTRDR) where 'A' is output class, and dataset 
        should be opened for output in the program. Define a 80 byte record 
        layout for the file.
        What are the differences between OS VS COBOL and VS COBOL II? 
        OS/VS Cobol pgms can only run in 24 bit addressing mode, VS Cobol II 
        pgms can run either in 24 bit or 31 bit addressing modes.
        Report writer is supported only in OS/VS Cobol.
        USAGE IS POINTER is supported only in VS COBOL II.
        Reference modification eg: WS-VAR(1:2) is supported only in VS COBOL II.
        EVALUATE is supported only in VS COBOL II.
        Scope terminators are supported only in VS COBOL II.
        OS/VS Cobol follows ANSI 74 stds while VS COBOL II follows ANSI 85 stds.
        Under CICS Calls between VS COBOL II programs are supported.
        What are the steps you go through while creating a COBOL program 
        executable? 
         
        DB2 precompiler (if embedded sql used), CICS translator (if CICS pgm), 
        Cobol compiler, Link editor.
        If DB2 program, create plan by binding the DBRMs.
        Can you call an OS VS COBOL pgm from a VS COBOL II pgm ?
      In non-CICS environment, it is possible. In CICS, this is not possible.
