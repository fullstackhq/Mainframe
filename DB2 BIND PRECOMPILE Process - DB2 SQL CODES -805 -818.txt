INTRODUCTION


Static SQL - COBOL PRE-compile process


For COBOL-Static SQL program, program needs to be precompiled before doing actual 
compilation of that program.


Following are the 4 steps to compile a COBOL-DB2 program







STEP 1 -  DB2 PRECOMPILE Process
	
	The DB2 Precompile performs three functions. First, it checks the SQL in
	the program for errors. Second, it adds working storage areas and source
	code compatible statements that are used to invoke DB2. One of the working
	storage areas contains a literal "timestamp" called a consistency token.
	Finally, all of the SQL statements are extracted from the program source
	and placed into a member called the DataBase Request Module, or DBRM, which
	also contains the consistency token.



STEP 2 -	COMPILE 

	The modified source from the precompile is then compiled. The code is
	checked for errors, and a compiled version of the code is created.



STEP 3 -	LINK-EDIT

	The compiled code is link-edited along with statically called source language
	and DB2 run-time modules to create a Load Module. Imbedded in this
	module is the same consistency token that was generated in the precompile.
	If multiple DB2 programs are statically linked together, the resulting load
	module contains a consistency token for each one.



STEP 4 -	DB2 BIND

	The bind process reads the DBRM that was created in the precompile and
	prepares an access path to the data. This access path, along with the
	consistency token, is stored in the DB2 catalog as a Package. Every Package
	is bound into a Package List, or Collection. The name of the Collection is
	specified by the PACKAGE parameter. A Collection is a group of Packages
	that are included in one or more Plans. The QUALIFIER parameter of the
	bind is used to direct the SQL to the specific set of DB2 objects (tables,
	views, aliases or synonyms) qualified by this name.







EXECUTING COBOL-DB2 PROGRAM

	When COBOL-DB2 Program executes, the plan name must be specified. 
	For online CICS programs, the plan name is specified by Tran ID in
	the Resource Control Table (RCT). For a batch program, the plan name is
	specified in the SYSTSIN input DD. The packages for all DB2 programs
	executed under a Tran ID or batch job step must be included in collection
	bound into this plan. When the first SQL statement of each program is
	executed, DB2 searches the collections within the plan using the package name
	and consistency token from the load module. If an exact match is not
	found, a -805 SQLCODE is returned.
