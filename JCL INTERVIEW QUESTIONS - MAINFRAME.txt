      JCL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS 
       
      1. What is primary allocation for a dataset? 
      The space allocated when the dataset is first created.
      2. What is the difference between primary and secondary allocations for a 
      dataset? 
      Secondary allocation is done when more space is required than what has 
      already been allocated. 
      3.How many extents are possible for a sequential file ? For a VSAM file ? 
      16 extents on a volume for a sequential file and 123 for a VSAM file.
      4. What does a disposition of (NEW,CATLG,DELETE) mean? 
      That this is a new dataset and needs to be allocated, to CATLG the dataset 
      if the step is successful and to delete the dataset if the step abends.
      5. What does a disposition of (NEW,CATLG,KEEP) mean? 
      That this is a new dataset and needs to be allocated, to CATLG the dataset 
      if the step is successful and to KEEP but not CATLG the dataset if the 
      step abends. Thus if the step abends, the dataset would not be catalogued 
      and we would need to supply the vol. ser the next time we refer to it.
      6. How do you access a file that had a disposition of KEEP? 
      Need to supply volume serial no. VOL=SER=xxxx.
      7. What does a disposition of (MOD,DELETE,DELETE) mean ? 
      The MOD will cause the dataset to be created (if it does not exist), and 
      then the two DELETEs will cause the dataset to be deleted whether the step 
      abends or not. This disposition is used to clear out a dataset at the 
      beginning of a job. 
      8. What is the DD statement for a output file? 
      Unless allocated earlier, will have the foll parameters: 
      DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE), UNIT , SPACE & DCB .
      9. What do you do if you do not want to keep all the space allocated to a 
      dataset? 
      Specify the parameter RLSE ( release ) in the SPACE e.g. 
      SPACE=(CYL,(50,50),RLSE)
      10. What is DISP=(NEW,PASS,DELETE)? 
      This is a new file and create it, if the step terminates normally, pass it 
      to the subsequent steps and if step abends, delete it. This dataset will 
      not exist beyond the JCL.
      11. How do you create a temporary dataset? Where will you use them? 
      Temporary datasets can be created either by not specifying any DSNAME or 
      by specifying the temporary file indicator as in DSN=&&TEMP. 
      We use them to carry the output of one step to another step in the same 
      job. The dataset will not be retained once the job completes.
      12. How do you restart a proc from a particular step? 
      In job card, specify RESTART=procstep.stepname
      where procstep = name of the jcl step that invoked the proc 
      and stepname = name of the proc step where you want execution to start
      13. How do you skip a particular step in a proc/JOB? 
      Can use either condition codes or use the jcl control statement IF (only 
      in ESA JCL)
      13a. A PROC has five steps. Step 3 has a condition code. How can you 
      override/nullify this condition code? 
      Provide the override on the EXEC stmt in the JCL as follows:
      //STEP001 EXEC procname,COND.stepname=value
      All parameters on an EXEC stmt in the proc such as COND, PARM have to be 
      overridden like this.
      14. How do you override a specific DDNAME/SYSIN in PROC from a JCL? 
      //<stepname.dd> DSN=...
      15. What is NOTCAT 2 ? 
      This is an MVS message indicating that a duplicate catalog entry exists. 
      E.g., if you already have a dataset with dsn = �xxxx.yyyy� and u try 
      to create one with disp new,catlg, you would get this error. the program 
      open and write would go through and at the end of the step the system 
      would try to put it in the system catalog. at this point since an entry 
      already exists the catlg would fail and give this message. you can fix the 
      problem by deleting/uncataloging the first data set and going to the 
      volume where the new dataset exists(this info is in the msglog of the job) 
      and cataloging it.
      16. What is 'S0C7' abend? 
      Caused by invalid data in a numeric field.
      17. What is a S0C4 error ? 
      Storage violation error - can be due to various reasons. e.g.: READING a 
      file that is not open, invalid address referenced due to subscript error.
      18. What are SD37, SB37, SE37 abends? 
      All indicate dataset out of space. SD37 - no secondary allocation was 
      specified. SB37 - end of vol. and no further volumes specified. SE37 - 
      Max. of 16 extents already allocated.
      19. What is S322 abend ? 
      Indicates a time out abend. Your program has taken more CPU time than the 
      default limit for the job class. Could indicate an infinite loop.
      20. Why do you want to specify the REGION parameter in a JCL step? 
      To override the REGION defined at the JOB card level.
      REGION specifies the max region size. REGION=0K or 0M or omitting REGION 
      means no limit will be applied.
      21. What does the TIME parameter signify ? What does TIME=1440 mean ? 
      TIME parameter can be used to overcome S322 abends for programs that 
      genuinely need more CPU time. TIME=1440 means no CPU time limit is to be 
      applied to this step.
      22. What is COND=EVEN ? 
      Means execute this step even if any of the previous steps, terminated 
      abnormally.
      23. What is COND=ONLY ? 
      Means execute this step only if any of the previous steps, terminated 
      abnormally.
      24. How do you check the syntax of a JCL without running it? 
      TYPERUN=SCAN on the JOB card or use JSCAN.
      25. What does IEBGENER do? 
      Used to copy one QSAM file to another. Source dataset should be described 
      using SYSUT1 ddname. Destination dataset should be decribed using SYSUT2. 
      IEBGENR can also do some reformatting of data by supplying control cards 
      via SYSIN.
      26. How do you send the output of a COBOL program to a member of a PDS? 
      Code the DSN as pds(member) with a DISP of SHR. The disp applies to the 
      pds and not to a specific member.
      27. I have multiple jobs ( JCLs with several JOB cards ) in a member. What 
      happens if I submit it? 
      Multiple jobs are submitted (as many jobs as the number of JOB cards). 
      28. I have a COBOL program that ACCEPTs some input data. How do you code 
      the JCL statment for this? ( How do you code instream data in a JCL? ) 
      //SYSIN DD*
      input data
      input data
      /*
      29. Can you code instream data in a PROC ? 
      No.
      30. How do you overcome this limitation ? 
      One way is to code SYSIN DD DUMMY in the PROC, and then override this from 
      the JCL with instream data.
      31. How do you run a COBOL batch program from a JCL? How do you run a 
      COBOL/DB2 program? 
      To run a non DB2 program,
      //STEP001 EXEC PGM=MYPROG
      To run a DB2 program,
      //STEP001 EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01
      //SYSTSIN DD *
      DSN SYSTEM(....)
      RUN PROGRAM(MYPROG)
      PLAN(.....) LIB(....) PARMS(...)
      /*
      32. What is STEPLIB, JOBLIB? What is it used for? 
      Specifies that the private library (or libraries) specified should be 
      searched before the default system libraries in order to locate a program 
      to be executed.
      STEPLIB applies only to the particular step, JOBLIB to all steps in the 
      job.
      33. What is order of searching of the libraries in a JCL? 
      First any private libraries as specified in the STEPLIB or JOBLIB, then 
      the system libraries such as SYS1.LINKLIB. The system libraries are 
      specified in the linklist. 
      34. What happens if both JOBLIB & STEPLIB is specified ? 
      JOBLIB is ignored.
      35. When you specify mutiple datasets in a JOBLIB or STEPLIB, what factor 
      determines the order? 
      The library with the largest block size should be the first one.
      36. How to change default proclib ? 
      //ABCD JCLLIB ORDER=(ME.MYPROCLIB,SYS1.PROCLIB)
      37. The disp in the JCL is MOD and the program opens the file in OUTPUT 
      mode. What happens ? 
      The disp in the JCL is SHR and the pgm opens the file in EXTEND mode. What 
      happens ? 
      Records will be written to end of file (append) when a WRITE is done in 
      both cases.
      38. What are the valid DSORG values ? 
      PS - QSAM, PO - Partitioned, IS - ISAM
       
      39. What are the differences between JES2 & JES3 ? 
      JES3 allocates datasets for all the steps before the job is scheduled. In 
      JES2, allocation of datasets required by a step are done only just before 
      the step executes. 
      ????? Can anyone add more
