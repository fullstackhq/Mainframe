CHAPTER - 2



          











As we discussed in Chapter-1 , Three important input operations are

1. JOB   

2. EXEC  

3. DD


Now let us look at JOB statement
 
   
Syntax of JOB Statement





EXPLANATION to keyword parameters
                 
CLASS  PRTY  MSGCLASS  MSGLEVEL  TYPRUN  NOTIFY



1. CLASS - Some jobs can be short running, some jobs may take more time other 
           may use havy resources. CLASS keyword parameter is used to tell to 
           OS about the nature of job we are submitting.

   Syntax        ->  CLASS=jobclass  

   Valid values  ->  Any alpha betical character between A - Z  or
                     numbers between 0 - 9   

   Example JCL   ->  //MYJOB JOB (3345Y),'KRISHNA REDDY',CLASS=K



2. PRTY  - It is related to CLASS parameter. It assigns priority to jobs which 
           belong to the same class. Higher number takes precedence over the 
           job with lower number. A job with priority of 12 will run before a 
           job with priority 5.

   Syntax        ->  PRTY=priority

   Valid values  ->  Any value between 0 to 15

   Example JCL   ->  //MYJOB JOB (345Y),'KRISHNA REDDY',CLASS=8,PRTY=6 



3. MSGCLASS - The MSGCLASS parameter determines the output device to which 
              system messages and JCL messages are written

   Syntax        ->  MSGCLASS=output-class-name

   Valid values  ->  Any alpha betical character between A - Z  or 
                     number between 0 - 9   

   Example JCL   ->  //MYJOB JOB (456Y),'KRISHNA REDDY',CLASS=7,PRTY=5,MSGCLASS=A


                     
4. MSGLEVEL - is used to tell JCL, which messages to be printed in the device 
              specified in MSGCLASS parameter

   Syntax        ->  MSGLEVEL=(statements,messages)

   Valid values  ->  Statements may be the number 0,1,2 and messages can be 0 or 1

                     STATEMENT
                     0  -  Related to job statements only printed
                     1  -  jcl will be printed 
                           (which includes all cataloged/symbolic parameters)
                     2  -  only the input jcl statements being printed

                     MESSAGES           
                     0  -  Allocation/termination messages will be printed
                           If job terminates abnormally
                     1  -  Allocation/termination messages will be printed
                           regardless of whether the job terminates normally or 
						   abnormally.

    Example JCL  -> //MYJOB JOB (3456Y),'SR',CLASS=8,MSGCLASS=S,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)



5. TYPRUN - The TYPRUN parameter is used to specify whether job is to be held 
            until further notice or for syntax checking
              
    Syntax        ->  TYPRUN=HOLD  -  Job held until further notice 
                                or
                     TYPRUN=SCAN  -  Check Jcl for syntax checking

                                                                

    Example JCL  ->  //MYJOB JOB (3456Y),'KRISHNA',CLASS=8,PRTY=9,TYPRUN=HOLD


6. NOTIFY - The NOTIFY parameter is used to direct the system, where it has to 
            send the success/failure message after completing the job.

    Syntax        ->  NOTIFY=userid/&SYSUID


    EXAMPLE JCL  ->  //MYJOB JOB (3456Y),'KRISHNA REDDY',CLASS=8,NOTIFY=&SYSUID

                     &SYSUID - the userid from which user it has been submited 

                     //MYJOB JOB (34W5),'KRISHNA REDDY',CLASS=8,NOTIFY=ERT54

                     It send the sucess/failture message to ERT54 userid
