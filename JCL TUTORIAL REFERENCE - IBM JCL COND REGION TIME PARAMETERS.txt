PARAMETERS IN BOTH STATEMENTS (JOB and EXEC)











COND  REGION  TIME 

These parameters can code in both JOB and EXEC statements, When we code 
these parameters on both statement, 

JOB - REGION     will override     EXEC - REGION
        
JOB - COND       will override     EXEC - COND

EXEC - TIME      will overrirde    JOB - TIME


Now let us see details of these parameters



REGION - Specifies the amount of space should be used at the time of 
         running a job/step
 
         Syntax  ->      REGION=< value >K
                              or
                         REGION=< value >M

         Example JCL -> //MYJOB  JOB   (AE32),'RAMESH'
                        //STEP1  EXEC  PGM=COBPROG,
                        //            REGION=67K 

          
 All available storage is assigned to the job or jobstep, If REGION is coded 0K or 0M  



COND  - Each step sends an  a return code to the system upon completion. 
        This is called condition code. COND parameter is used to control 
        the execution of subsequent job steps, depending on the condition
        code that is returned for prior step.

        Return code number between 0 and 4095

                 
  Syntax   ->  COND=(comparsion-code,condition)  
                              (If coded on job)

               COND=(comparsion-code,condition [,stepname] [,EVEN / ONLY]) 
                                                        (If coded on step)                             
                               
               condition can be GT,GE,LT,LE,EQ,NE

                             
                 
  Example JCL  ->  COND coded on JOB
 
                    //MYJOB  JOB   (R475),'KRISHNA REDDY'
                    //             COND=(4,GT)
                    //STEP1  EXEC  PGM=COBPROG
                    //STEP2  EXEC  PGM=COBPROG2
                             
                    In this example we are specifing that if the number 
                    4 is grater than the return code of STEP1, then STEP2 
                    is to be bypassed. It is elaborated further in the 
                    following image
                            
                         

                            
                     COND coded on EXEC statement

                     //MYJOB  JOB  (U769),'KRISHNA REDDY'
                     //STEP1  EXEC  PGM=PROG1
                     //STEP2  EXEC  PGM=COBPROG,
                     //             COND=(8,EQ,STEP1)
                     //
 
                     In this example the COND parameter is used to specify that 
                     STEP2 should be by passed if 8 is equal to the return code 
                     issued by STEP1.



TIME -  The time parameter is used to specify the amount of CPU time that a 
        job or job step is permitted to utilize.

  Syntax    -> TIME=minutes
                   OR
               TIME=([minutes] [,seconds])

               minutes can be between 1 and 1439 
               seconds can be between 1 and 59


  Example JCL ->  If coded on JOB

                //MYJOB  JOB   (E234),'RAMESH KRISHNA',TIME=(20,30)
                //STEP1  EXEC  PGM=COBPROG1
                //STEP2  EXEC  PGM=COBPROG2 
                //STEP3  EXEC  PGM=COBPROG3   

                In this example 20 minutes 30 seconds time alloted 
   			    to job. All steps in this job STEP1 STEP2 STEP3 should 
  			    complete its task within 20 min. 30 sec.


                If coded on STEP

                //MYJOB  JOB   (R567),'KRISHNA'
                //STEP1  EXEC  PGM=COBPRO
                //             TIME=30

                In this example 30 min. time is alloted to STEP1. 
                If STEP1 requires more than 30 min. MYJOB will 
                terminate abnormally.              


                If coded on both STEP AND JOB 
 
                //SECOND JOB   ,'R. KRISHNA',TIME=3
                //STEP1  EXEC  PGM=C,TIME=2
                //STEP2  EXEC  PGM=D,TIME=2


               In this example, the job is allowed 3 minutes of execution time. 
               Each step is allowed 2 minutes of execution time. Should either 
               step try to execute beyond 2 minutes, the job will terminate 
               beginning with that step. If STEP1 executes in 1.74 minutes and 
               if STEP2 tries to execute beyond 1.26 minutes, the job will be 
               terminated because of the 3-minute time limit specified on the 
               JOB statement. 



 By coding TIME=1440 or TIME=NOLIMIT, It will give a job or step an unlimited amount of time. 

				
 To allow a job or step to use the maximum amount of time, code TIME=MAXIMUM. Coding TIME=MAXIMUM allows the job or step to run for 357912 minutes. (Approx. 248 days)
