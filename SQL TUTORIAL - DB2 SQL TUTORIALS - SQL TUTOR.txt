                              DB2 SQL INTRODUCTION






                              SQL (structured query language) is used to 
                              acccess, manipulate or control the access of 
                              rantional database. Databases like DB2, ORACLE, 
                              SQL SERVER 2000 support the SQL (Structured query 
                              language). 

                              In relational database data represented as tables. 
                              Tables contains the data in rows and column. Rows 
                              are called as records, columns called as fields. 



                               




                              PRIMARY KEY - PRIMARY KEY is one column or 
                              combination columns. This primary key is to 
                              identify the records uniquely in the table. 
                              Applications/programs normally proides PRIMARY KEY 
                              value to get the record values from the table. 
                              PRIMARY KEY columns have the unique index (unqiue 
                              indexes wont allow duplicate values) defined on 
                              them, so that processing time of SQL will be very 
                              less compare than the non-index columns.


                              FOREIGN KEY - FOREIGN KEY is one or more columns 
                              in a table that refers to the primary key of 
                              another table. Through this key we can establish a 
                              relation between two tables. If table B foreign 
                              key refers table A's primary key, DB2 / ORACLE 
                              wont allow to enter the records into table B if 
                              the foreign key value in the input data is not 
                              present in the table A's primary key list of 
                              values.




                              DB2 SQL (Structured query language) commands can 
                              be classified into 3 main categories DDL, DML and 
                              DCL.


                              DDL ( Data Definition Language ) - These 
                              statements usaully used by DBA's or Senior 
                              Programmers to create table spaces, tables , 
                              indexes etc...

                              COMMANDS : 
                              CREATE
                              DROP
                              ALTER


                              DML (Data Manipulatoin Language ) - using these 
                              statements we can select, insert, update and 
                              delete the data in the database. 

                              COMMANDS :
                              SELECT, 
                              INSERT, 
                              UPDATE, 
                              DELETE


                              DCL (Data Control Language ) - Using these 
                              statements DBA / user who has authority to grant 
                              can grant accecss or revoke the authority of 
                              accessing DB2 database.

                              COMMANDS :
                              GRANT
                              REVOKE
